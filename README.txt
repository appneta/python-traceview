AppNeta TraceView instrumentation libraries for Python
=====================================================

The 'oboe' and 'oboeware' modules provide support for instrumenting
programs for use with the Tracelytics Oboe instrumentation library.

The oboe module provides a Pythonic interface to liboboe for C, and
the oboeware module provides middleware and other components for
popular web frameworks such as Django, Tornado, Pylons, and WSGI.
